SELF PROJECT

In this project I have focused on fundamentals of robotics and machine mechanisms.
All these problems are in some way related to path planning at a very basic level.
Aim of this project is to enhance understanding of following concepts:
1. Dijkstra's algorithm
2. Inverse kinematics and it's visualization
3. Proportional Integral controller algorithm
4. Robotic manipulators and Degrees of freedom

To execute the program, go to MATLAB and run the 'main.m' file.
for 'Inverse algebraic manipulator control' and 'dijkstra's algorithm simulation' 
just execute the MATLAB script in those folder.

a. Manipulator:
In this code, you can vary the parameters [a, alpha, d, theta] and see the motion of the manipulator through figure.
this will help you understand the degrees of freedom concept and manipulator design.

b. Dijkstra's algorithm simulation:
If you have studied dijkstra's algorithm then this is a nice simulation for it's working.
this algorithm has very important application in the field of robotics for path planning.

c. 2-DOF manipulator and inverse kinematics:
This code is to visualize and implement inverse kinematics in a code. 2 DOF manipulator is taken just as an 
example for demonstrating application of inverse kinematics.

d. Inverse algebraic manipulator control:
This example demonstrates the Proportional-Integral controller functioning and implementation.
